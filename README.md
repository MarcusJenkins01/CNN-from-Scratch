<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification from scratch, using only pure Python with no external dependencies. This demonstrates how CNNs work on a low level for educational purposes.
    
Features:
* The Variable class for tracking of gradients and back-propagation.
* The Tensor class for multi-dimensional tensors, consisting of Variable objects.
* Element-wise and matrix operations for tensors, including ReLU activation function.
* The ConvolutionalLayer2d which implements a convolutional layer using the Tensor operations.

## Application
The demos folder includes some example architectures for image classification.
